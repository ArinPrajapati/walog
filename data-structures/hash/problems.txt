# Basic Problems
1. Implement a hash table from scratch.
2. Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a string using a hash map.
3. Create a hash map to count the frequency of elements in an array.

# Intermediate Problems
1. Implement a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a hash map and a doubly linked list.
2. Given two arrays, find the intersection using a hash set.
3. Write a function to group anagrams from a list of strings using a hash map.

# Advanced Problems
1. Design and implement a consistent hashing algorithm.
2. Implement a spell checker using a hash map and edit distance algorithm.
3. Write a function to find the longest substring without repeating characters using a hash map.

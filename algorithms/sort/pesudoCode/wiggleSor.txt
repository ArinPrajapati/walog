function wiggleSort takes arr

sort the arr
high = arr.length - 1
low = 0
some loop i will track the currect variable:
we will check if the i is even or not

if even
	then we will check if i + 1 is smaller than i
		
		we will replace  i + 1 with arr[high] 
		high--

	then we will check if i - 1 is smaller than i
	        we will replace i - 1 with arr[high]
		high--

else 

	then we will check if i - 1 is bigger than i
		
		we will replace i - 1 with arr[low]
		low++
	then we will check if i + 1 is bigger than i 
		we will replace i + 1 with
